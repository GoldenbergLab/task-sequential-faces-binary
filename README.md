# sequential-amplification-singleface-gender-sadness
Part of overall gender & emotion project to examine the effect of viewing faces of different genders and emotional valences on judgments of emotionality. This task is intended to validate sadness stimuli to show that when participants view single images and rate their emotionality (rather than sequences of images), there is no gender effect.
